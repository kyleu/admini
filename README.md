## Building

- Run `bin/bootstrap.sh` to install required Go utilities
- Run `make build` to produce a binary in `./build`, or run `bin/dev.sh` to recompile and restart automatically

For full stack development, you'll need some tools installed:

- For TypeScript changes, use `bin/build-client.sh`; you'll need `node` installed
- For a developer environment, run `bin/workspace.sh`, which will watch all files and hot-reload (iTerm2 required)
